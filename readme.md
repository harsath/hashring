## hashring - consistent hashing implementation
HashRing is a tiny (and inefficient :P) implementation of [consistent hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing) technique. It's commonly used in applications
like [load balancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)).
